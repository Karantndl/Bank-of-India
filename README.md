The buttons that actually work are the Mortgage Calculator, the nav bar, and some footer links like Help & FAQs.
I developed this website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. The site allows users to calculate their mortgage eligibility. It also includes navigation to various pages such as Home, About Us, Contact Us, Services, Mortgage Calculator, Help, FAQs, and more.
